# Provisions

## Description

**Provisions** is an application that generates entreé and wine pairings inspired by ingredients, one’s provisions, inputted by the user. Who knew one day as a result of a deadly global pandemic, we’d take for granted the simple pleasure of dining out? **Provisions** is inspired by enjoying a meal anywhere other than your own home and making the best out of a 2020/2021-situation.
