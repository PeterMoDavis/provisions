# Provisions

## Description

An application that generates meal and wine pairings inspired by ingredients, one’s provisions, inputted by the user. Who knew one day as a result of a deadly global pandemic, we’d take for granted the simple pleasure of dining out? Prosions is inspired by enjoying a meal anywhere other than your own home and making the best out of a 2020/2021-situation.
